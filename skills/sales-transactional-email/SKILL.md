# Transactional Email Delivery

Help the user with transactional/triggered email — from provider selection and template design through API integration, SMTP relay, deliverability, and monitoring. This skill is tool-agnostic but includes platform-specific guidance for SendGrid, Postmark, Mailgun, Brevo, Customer.io, Mailchimp/Mandrill, and Amazon SES.

## Step 1 — Gather context

Ask the user:

1. **What type of transactional email do you need help with?**
   - A) Order confirmations / receipts / shipping notifications
   - B) Password resets / account verification / 2FA
   - C) Welcome emails / onboarding sequences triggered by signup
   - D) Billing / invoice / subscription notifications
   - E) Alert / notification emails (activity, mentions, reminders)
   - F) Provider selection — choosing the right transactional email service
   - G) Delivery issues — emails not arriving, going to spam, delayed
   - H) API/SMTP integration — connecting your app to a provider
   - I) Template design — building reusable transactional templates
   - J) Monitoring & analytics — tracking delivery, opens, bounces
   - K) Something else — describe it

2. **What's your current setup?**
   - A) No provider yet — starting from scratch
   - B) Using SendGrid
   - C) Using Postmark
   - D) Using Mailgun
   - E) Using Brevo (Sendinblue)
   - F) Using Customer.io
   - G) Using Mailchimp / Mandrill
   - H) Using Amazon SES
   - I) Using another provider
   - J) Using my own SMTP server

3. **What's your volume?**
   - A) Low (< 1K emails/day)
   - B) Medium (1K-50K/day)
   - C) High (50K-500K/day)
   - D) Very high (500K+/day)

**If the user's request already provides most of this context, skip directly to the relevant step.** Lead with your best-effort answer using reasonable assumptions (stated explicitly), then ask only the most critical 1-2 clarifying questions at the end.

## Step 2 — Strategy and approach

### Transactional vs marketing email

**Transactional emails** are triggered by a user action or system event — they're expected and usually 1:1. They don't require marketing consent (CAN-SPAM exemption) but must be genuinely transactional.

| Transactional | Marketing |
|---|---|
| Order confirmation | Promotional campaign |
| Password reset | Newsletter |
| Shipping notification | Product announcement |
| Account verification | Re-engagement campaign |
| Invoice / receipt | Discount / sale notification |

**Key principle**: Keep transactional and marketing email on separate sending infrastructure (different IPs/domains) so marketing reputation issues don't affect transactional delivery.

### Provider selection framework

| Factor | SendGrid | Postmark | Mailgun | Brevo | Customer.io | SES |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Scale + marketing combo | Deliverability-first | Developer flexibility | All-in-one + marketing | Behavior-triggered | Raw volume + cost |
| **Deliverability** | Good | Excellent (98.7%) | Good | Good | Good | Good (self-managed) |
| **Pricing model** | Per email | Per email | Per email | Volume tiers | Per profile | Per email (cheapest) |
| **Free tier** | 100/day | 100/month | 1K/month (trial) | 300/day | None | 62K/month (from EC2) |
| **SMTP relay** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| **REST API** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Templates** | Dynamic (Handlebars) | Handlebars | Handlebars | UI builder + API | Liquid | Basic |
| **Inbound parsing** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Webhooks** | Yes (Event Webhook) | Yes (7 types) | Yes (8 events) | Yes | Yes | SNS notifications |

### Template best practices

1. **Keep it simple** — transactional emails should be clear, not flashy
2. **Include essential info above the fold** — order number, tracking link, action button
3. **Use dynamic parameters** — never hardcode user-specific data
4. **Test across clients** — Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail render differently
5. **Include plain-text fallback** — some recipients/clients need it
6. **Brand consistently** — logo, colors, footer, but don't over-design

### Deliverability for transactional email

1. **Dedicated sending domain** — use `mail.example.com` or `notify.example.com`, not your main domain
2. **Authenticate everything** — SPF, DKIM, DMARC (p=quarantine or p=reject)
3. **Dedicated IP** — at 50K+/month volume, get a dedicated IP and warm it
4. **Separate streams** — keep transactional and marketing on different IPs/subdomains
5. **Monitor bounces** — suppress hard bounces immediately, track soft bounce patterns
6. **Watch complaint rates** — transactional should be near 0% complaints

## Step 3 — Platform-specific guidance

### In Brevo
- **API endpoint**: `POST https://api.brevo.com/v3/smtp/email`
- **Auth**: `api-key` header
- **Templates**: Create in Brevo UI, reference via `templateId` with `params` object
- **SMTP relay**: `smtp-relay.brevo.com:587` (STARTTLS), login = account email, password = SMTP key
- **Webhooks**: Create via API — events: delivered, opened, clicked, hardBounce, softBounce, unsubscribed, complaint, blocked
- **Free tier**: 300 emails/day (transactional included)
- **Dedicated IP**: Available on paid plans, configure in Settings → Senders, Domains & Dedicated IPs
- **Strength**: All-in-one — transactional + marketing + CRM in one platform. Good for teams that don't want separate tools.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-brevo`

### In Iterable
- **API endpoint**: `POST https://api.iterable.com/api/email/target` (US) or `https://api.eu.iterable.com/api/email/target` (EU)
- **Auth**: `Api-Key` header
- **How it works**: Create a triggered campaign in Iterable, then fire via API with recipient email, campaign ID, and personalization data fields. Triggered campaigns are the mechanism for transactional email — there's no separate transactional API.
- **Templates**: Handlebars templating with dynamic variables, conditional blocks, and Catalog data for product recommendations
- **Webhooks**: System webhooks for delivery events (send, open, click, bounce, complaint). Configure at Integrations > System Webhooks.
- **No SMTP relay**: Iterable is API-only — no SMTP gateway option
- **Strength**: Best when you're already using Iterable for marketing engagement and want transactional email in the same platform. Triggered campaigns share the same template engine and analytics as marketing campaigns.
- **Limitation**: Enterprise pricing (MAU-based). Triggered campaigns are the same mechanism as marketing triggers — no separate SLA tier for transactional. No SMTP for legacy apps.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-iterable`

### In Braze
- **API endpoint**: `POST https://rest.iad-XX.braze.com/transactional/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/send` (instance-specific URL)
- **Auth**: Bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_REST_API_KEY`)
- **How it works**: Create a Transactional Email Campaign in the Braze dashboard, then trigger via API with recipient and personalization data. Transactional campaigns are separate from marketing Campaigns/Canvas.
- **Templates**: Liquid templating (not Handlebars) with Connected Content for real-time external data at send time
- **SLA guarantees**: 99.9% uptime SLA. Transactional sends are prioritized over marketing messages in Braze's infrastructure.
- **Webhooks**: Currents streaming for delivery events (send, delivery, open, click, bounce, spam) — streams to data warehouse (Snowflake, S3, etc.), not individual webhook URLs
- **No SMTP relay**: Braze is API-only for transactional — no SMTP gateway option
- **Strength**: Best when you're already using Braze for marketing engagement and want transactional email in the same platform with unified user profiles and analytics.
- **Limitation**: Enterprise pricing (MAU-based). Overkill if you only need transactional email. No SMTP relay for legacy apps.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-braze`

### In GetResponse (MAX only)
- **API endpoint**: `POST https://api.getresponse.com/v3/transactional-emails` (retail) or `POST https://api3.getresponse360.com/v3/transactional-emails` (MAX)
- **Auth**: `X-Auth-Token: api-key {your-api-key}` header. MAX users must also include `X-Domain` header.
- **How it works**: Send transactional emails via API with recipient, subject, and HTML content. Transactional emails are separate from marketing newsletters and autoresponders.
- **Important**: Transactional email is **only available on MAX/Enterprise plans**. Users on Free, Starter, Marketer, or Creator plans cannot send transactional email through GetResponse — they must use a separate provider (SendGrid, Postmark, Mailgun, etc.).
- **Rate limits**: Same as marketing API — 30,000 calls/10 min, 80 calls/sec, max 10 simultaneous.
- **No SMTP relay**: GetResponse transactional is API-only.
- **Strength**: Convenient if you're already on GetResponse MAX for marketing and want transactional in the same platform with unified contact data.
- **Limitation**: MAX-only pricing makes this impractical unless you're already on MAX for other reasons. No separate SLA tier for transactional delivery. Limited template engine compared to SendGrid/Postmark.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-getresponse`

### In SendGrid
- **API endpoint**: `POST https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send`
- **Auth**: Bearer token
- **Templates**: Dynamic templates with Handlebars (`{{variable}}`)
- **SMTP relay**: `smtp.sendgrid.net:587`
- **Webhooks**: Event Webhook — delivered, open, click, bounce, dropped, deferred, spam report
- **Free tier**: 100 emails/day forever
- **Strength**: Scale + ecosystem. Good for teams also using Twilio for SMS.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-sendgrid`

### In Postmark
- **API endpoint**: `POST https://api.postmarkapp.com/email`
- **Auth**: `X-Postmark-Server-Token` header
- **Templates**: Handlebars with layouts (shared headers/footers)
- **Message Streams**: Separate transactional and broadcast streams (enforced)
- **SMTP relay**: `smtp.postmarkapp.com:587`
- **Webhooks**: 7 types — delivery, bounce, spam complaint, open, click, subscription change, inbound
- **Free tier**: 100 emails/month
- **Strength**: Best deliverability (98.7% inbox placement). Opinionated — enforces transactional/broadcast separation. Sender vetting on signup.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-postmark`

### In Mailgun
- **API endpoint**: `POST https://api.mailgun.net/v3/{domain}/messages`
- **Auth**: Basic auth with `api:key-xxx`
- **Templates**: Handlebars
- **SMTP relay**: `smtp.mailgun.org:587`
- **Webhooks**: 8 event types — accepted, delivered, opened, clicked, unsubscribed, complained, bounced, failed
- **Strength**: Developer-friendly with flexible routing and inbound parsing. Good for complex email processing.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-mailgun`

### In Customer.io
- **API endpoint**: Transactional Messages API
- **Templates**: Liquid templating
- **Strength**: Behavior-triggered transactional messages tied to customer journey data. Best when you need transactional email + marketing automation with unified customer profiles.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-customerio`

### In Mailchimp / Mandrill
- **Mandrill** is Mailchimp's transactional email add-on ($20/mo + per-email)
- **API endpoint**: `POST https://mandrillapp.com/api/1.0/messages/send`
- **Templates**: Mandrill templates with merge tags
- **Strength**: Good if you're already on Mailchimp for marketing and want one vendor.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-mailchimp`

### In Amazon SES
- **API**: AWS SDK or SMTP interface
- **Auth**: AWS IAM credentials
- **Cheapest at scale**: ~$0.10 per 1,000 emails
- **Strength**: Raw cost efficiency at high volume. Requires more self-management (reputation monitoring, bounce handling, suppression lists).
- **Weakness**: No built-in template UI, no analytics dashboard — you build everything yourself or use a wrapper service.

## Step 4 — Actionable guidance

### Integration checklist

1. **Choose API or SMTP** — API is faster and more reliable; SMTP is easier for legacy apps
2. **Set up authentication** — API key or credentials for your chosen provider
3. **Create templates** — design templates in the provider's UI, reference by ID in API calls
4. **Implement sending** — API call or SMTP send from your application code
5. **Set up webhooks** — track delivery, bounces, complaints, opens/clicks
6. **Handle errors** — retry logic for 5xx errors, suppress on hard bounces
7. **Monitor** — track delivery rates, bounce rates, complaint rates daily

### Key metrics to track

| Metric | Healthy range | Action if outside |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery rate | > 98% | Check bounces, verify addresses at signup |
| Bounce rate | < 2% | Suppress hard bounces, validate emails |
| Complaint rate | < 0.01% | Ensure emails are genuinely transactional |
| Open rate | 40-80% (transactional) | Check subject lines, preview text |
| Time to inbox | < 10 seconds | Check provider status, API latency |

## Gotchas

1. **Don't mix transactional and marketing on the same IP/domain** — marketing reputation problems will tank transactional delivery. Use separate subdomains and ideally separate IPs.
2. **"Transactional" has a legal definition** — CAN-SPAM exempts transactional emails from opt-out requirements, but the email must be primarily transactional. An order confirmation with a 50% coupon at the top is marketing, not transactional.
3. **SMTP is not real-time** — SMTP queues add latency. For time-sensitive emails (2FA codes, password resets), use the REST API for faster delivery.
4. **Webhooks can fail silently** — if your webhook endpoint is down, you'll miss delivery/bounce events. Implement webhook logging and alerting.
5. **Template rendering varies by client** — Outlook uses Word's rendering engine. Always test templates in Litmus or Email on Acid, especially for layout-heavy designs.

## Examples

### Example 1: Choosing a transactional email provider
**User says**: "We're a SaaS startup sending about 5K transactional emails/day — order confirmations, password resets, and activity notifications. What provider should we use?"
**Skill does**: Evaluates volume (medium), use cases (standard transactional), and likely needs (reliability, good deliverability, reasonable cost). Recommends Postmark for best deliverability or SendGrid for more flexibility. Compares pricing at 150K/month volume.
**Result**: Clear recommendation with reasoning, cost comparison, and setup next steps

### Example 2: Debugging delivery delays
**User says**: "Our password reset emails are taking 30+ seconds to arrive via SMTP through Mailgun"
**Skill does**: Identifies SMTP queuing as likely cause. Recommends switching to REST API for time-sensitive emails. Shows Mailgun API example for password reset. Suggests monitoring with webhooks.
**Result**: Root cause identified, API migration code provided, monitoring setup

### Example 3: Setting up transactional email in Brevo
**User says**: "How do I send order confirmation emails through the Brevo API with dynamic order data?"
**Skill does**: Walks through creating a template in Brevo UI → calling POST /smtp/email with templateId and params → setting up delivery webhooks → error handling and retry logic
**Result**: Working transactional email flow with template, API integration, and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Transactional emails going to spam
**Symptom**: Order confirmations or account emails landing in spam
**Cause**: Usually domain authentication issues, shared IP reputation, or content triggers
**Solution**: 1) Verify SPF/DKIM/DMARC are properly configured. 2) Check if you're on a shared IP with bad reputation — consider dedicated IP. 3) Review email content for spam trigger words. 4) Ensure you're not mixing marketing content into transactional emails. See `/sales-deliverability`.

### High bounce rates on transactional email
**Symptom**: Bounce rate exceeding 2% on transactional sends
**Cause**: Sending to invalid addresses — users entering fake emails at signup, typos, abandoned accounts
**Solution**: 1) Implement real-time email validation at signup (ZeroBounce, Kickbox, or provider's built-in). 2) Use double opt-in for account creation. 3) Suppress hard bounces immediately. 4) Clean your contact list quarterly.

### Webhook events not arriving
**Symptom**: No webhook callbacks received after sending emails
**Cause**: Webhook endpoint misconfigured, firewall blocking provider IPs, or SSL certificate issues
**Solution**: 1) Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible (not localhost). 2) Check that your endpoint returns 200 within 5 seconds. 3) Whitelist provider IP ranges if behind a firewall. 4) Check provider's webhook logs for failed delivery attempts.
